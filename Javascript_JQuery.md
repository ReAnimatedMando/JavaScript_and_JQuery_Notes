##  How Javascript makes web pages more interactive
*   Access Content
    -   You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example;
        *   Select the text inside all of the h1> elements on a page
        *   Select any elements that have a class attribute with a value of note
        *   Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of email
    -   JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser.
*   Modifying Content
    -   You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example;
        *   Add a paragraph of text after the first h1> element
        *   Change the value of class attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
        *   Change the size or position of an img> element.
