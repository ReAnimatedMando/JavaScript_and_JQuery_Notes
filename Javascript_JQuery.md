##  The ABC of Programming
##  How Javascript makes web pages more interactive
*   Access Content
    -   You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example;
        *   Select the text inside all of the h1> elements on a page
        *   Select any elements that have a class attribute with a value of note
        *   Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of email
    -   JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser.
*   Modifying Content
    -   You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example;
        *   Add a paragraph of text after the first h1> element
        *   Change the value of class attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
        *   Change the size or position of an img> element
* Program Rules
    -   You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example;
        *   A gallery script could check which imagea user clicked on and display a larger version of that image
        *   A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a calculation, and display repayments
        *   An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport)
    -   JavaScript encompasses many of the traditional rules of programming. It can make the web page feel interactive by responding to what the user does.
*   React to Events
    -   You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.
    For example;
        *   A button is pressed
        *   A link is clicked (or tapped) on
        *   A cursor hovers over an element
        *   Information is added to a form
        *   An interval of time has passed
        *   A web page has finished loading
