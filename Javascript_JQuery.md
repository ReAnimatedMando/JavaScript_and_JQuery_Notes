##  The ABC of Programming
##  How Javascript makes web pages more interactive
*   Access Content
    -   You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example;
        *   Select the text inside all of the h1> elements on a page
        *   Select any elements that have a class attribute with a value of note
        *   Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of email
    -   JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser.
*   Modifying Content
    -   You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example;
        *   Add a paragraph of text after the first h1> element
        *   Change the value of class attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
        *   Change the size or position of an img> element
* Program Rules
    -   You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example;
        *   A gallery script could check which imagea user clicked on and display a larger version of that image
        *   A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a calculation, and display repayments
        *   An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport)
    -   JavaScript encompasses many of the traditional rules of programming. It can make the web page feel interactive by responding to what the user does.
*   React to Events
    -   You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.
    For example;
        *   A button is pressed
        *   A link is clicked (or tapped) on
        *   A cursor hovers over an element
        *   Information is added to a form
        *   An interval of time has passed
        *   A web page has finished loading
*   Examples of JavaScript in the Browser
    -   Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it's loaded in the browser. These rely on the ability to...
        *   Access - Get each image or slide from a slideshow page, get values from a field on the page, access links users click on, access pages to be replaced when reloading specific areas of the page.
        *   Modify - Only show first slide and hide others, change slide or img shown, show requested slide, showing warnings is field isn't filled out correctly, replace old content with new content, show subset of imgs that use certain tags.
        *   Program - Set timers for when to show slides, determine which slides to show, chech that information in fields are long enough, load new content that is required from a link, collect keywords from imgs, find the relevant subset of imgs that should be shown.
        *   React - Script triggered when the page loads, when user clicks button for different slide, user presses the submit button when they have entered their name, script triggers when user clicks on link.
##  What Is A Script & How Do I Create One?
*   A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You could compare scripts to any of the following.
    -   Recipes - By following the istructions in a recipe, one-by-one in the order set out, cooks can create a dish they have never made before.
    -   Handbooks - Handbooks contain procedures to follow in certain situations.
    -   Manuals - Contain series of tests to check the key functions along with details of how to fix. 
*   Scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step by step.
*   A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page.
*   Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them.
*   Writing a script - to write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
    -   Scripts may seem complicated at first but are really just a series of short instructions, each of which is performed in order to solve the problem at hand. This is how a script is like a recipe or manual, it allows a computer to solve a puzzle one step at a time.
        *   A computer doesn't learn how to perform tasks permanently and needs to follow instructions every time it performs the task so a program must give it enough detail to perform the task everytime as if it were its first time.
    -   Always start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.
        *   1. Define the goal - First, define the task you want to achieve like a puzzle you want the computer to solve.
        *   2. Design the script - Split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. Can be represented using a flow chart. You can write down individual steps the computer needs to perform in order to complete each task as well as any information it needs to perform the task, again like a recipe it needs to follow.
        *   3. Code each step - Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands, in our case JavaScript. 
            - It pays to spend time designing your script before you start writing it.
*   Designing a script: Tasks
    -   Once you know the goal of your script, you can work out the individual tasks needed to achive it. This high-level view of the tasks can be represented using a flowchart.
*   Designing a script: Steps
    -   Each individual task may be broken down into a sequence of steps. When you are ready to code the script, these steps can then be translated into individual lines of code.
        *   The steps that a computer needs to follow in order to perform a task are often very different from those that you or I might take.
