##  The ABC of Programming
##  How Javascript makes web pages more interactive
*   Access Content
    -   You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example;
        *   Select the text inside all of the h1> elements on a page
        *   Select any elements that have a class attribute with a value of note
        *   Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of email
    -   JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser.
*   Modifying Content
    -   You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example;
        *   Add a paragraph of text after the first h1> element
        *   Change the value of class attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
        *   Change the size or position of an img> element
* Program Rules
    -   You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example;
        *   A gallery script could check which imagea user clicked on and display a larger version of that image
        *   A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a calculation, and display repayments
        *   An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport)
    -   JavaScript encompasses many of the traditional rules of programming. It can make the web page feel interactive by responding to what the user does.
*   React to Events
    -   You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.
    For example;
        *   A button is pressed
        *   A link is clicked (or tapped) on
        *   A cursor hovers over an element
        *   Information is added to a form
        *   An interval of time has passed
        *   A web page has finished loading
*   Examples of JavaScript in the Browser
    -   Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it's loaded in the browser. These rely on the ability to...
        *   Access - Get each image or slide from a slideshow page, get values from a field on the page, access links users click on, access pages to be replaced when reloading specific areas of the page.
        *   Modify - Only show first slide and hide others, change slide or img shown, show requested slide, showing warnings is field isn't filled out correctly, replace old content with new content, show subset of imgs that use certain tags.
        *   Program - Set timers for when to show slides, determine which slides to show, chech that information in fields are long enough, load new content that is required from a link, collect keywords from imgs, find the relevant subset of imgs that should be shown.
        *   React - Script triggered when the page loads, when user clicks button for different slide, user presses the submit button when they have entered their name, script triggers when user clicks on link.
##  What Is A Script & How Do I Create One?
*   A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You could compare scripts to any of the following.
    -   Recipes - By following the istructions in a recipe, one-by-one in the order set out, cooks can create a dish they have never made before.
    -   Handbooks - Handbooks contain procedures to follow in certain situations.
    -   Manuals - Contain series of tests to check the key functions along with details of how to fix. 
*   Scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step by step.
*   A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page.
*   Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them.
